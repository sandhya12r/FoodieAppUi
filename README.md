## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
A website for a fictitious restauran named 'Appetite', which is responsive on all screen sizes as well as has different set of functionalities depending upon the type of user you are. Admins can add and edit dishes, while a user can add the dishes to the cart, and place the order. With Next-Auth, we have also achived google integration for setting up login for the user using their Google Accounts.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

- VS Code
- Eclipse IDE

After the app is created copy your uinque CLIENT_ID AND CLIENT_SECRET into .env.local in the respective fields.

### Installing
You need to clone two repositories for this web application to work.
- Appetite_FrontEnd: https://github.com/sandhya12r/FoodieAppUi
- Appetite-Services: https://github.com/sandhya12r/FoodieApp

After successfully cloning the two repositories. Open the Appetite_FrontEnd with VS Code. Open the terminal in the VS Code using 'CTRL'+ ` . In the terminal install the dependencies using the following commands

```
CREATE DATABASE restaurant_db;

Then run the program as Java Application on server port 8080 (It will automatically run on this port number). Once both the servers are up and running, open the following link in Chrome
